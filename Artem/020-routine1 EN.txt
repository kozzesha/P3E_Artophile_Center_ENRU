Hi Didi,
The reason I wanted to talk to you today was to see whether we could have you as the project manager for this new project. However, what you said made me think twice. I don't think you're ready to manage such an important project yet, but I still see a bright future for you. Meanwhile, study more and gain more experience in your existing projects.

Best regards,
Eris
