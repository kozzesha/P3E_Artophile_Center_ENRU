q: OK, almost done with focused communication... but one more thing before I close it...
i: Mirai...
u: Yes?
i: Can you come in here for a moment?
u: How can I help you, Didi?
i: Did you see my last public email?
u: Yes!
u: Did you send it to everyone in the company?!
i: Yes.
i: People should know about the projects that are being run in the company.
i: Also, we may need their help on the project one day.
u: I see.
i: It was part of A10, but there's another thing we need to do in A10, and I'd like to ask you to do that.
u: Sure.
i: I need you to design a roll-up banner for the project, print it, and place it in the lobby.
u: Hmm...
u: But why?
i: It has the same purpose as the email, to make sure that people know such a project exists in the company.
i: Also, do you remember the risk that you're a custodian for?
u: Yes, I know what you mean.
i: Good.
u: What type of design do you want for the banner?
i: A simple design.
i: Use the design and perspective of the building that Azar has provided, and add some text and background.
i: When you're done, ask Azar to check it and comment on it.
u: OK.
i: Also, ask Elvan, from internal services, if it's OK to put the banner in the lobby.
u: OK.
