i: So, we forecast that we'll be 5 artopools over budget and half a month late at completion.
i: We need to find a way to recover from those deviations.
u: Didi, we checked it with the team yesterday!
i: What was the result?
u: Are you sure you don't remember?
i: Just assume that I've traveled through time and don't know what happened yesterday.
u: Hmm...
u: OK.
u: So, the idea is that we can recover the delay by increasing the speed of finishing of conference room #2 and the main hall, but that increases our costs by 2 artopools.
i: So, there's no way we can recover from both deviations?
u: No.
i: Did we check every possibility?
u: Yes.
i: OK.
i: Then we should communicate it to Anan when initiating the next month and ask for an increase in budgeted time and cost.
u: So, do we only raise these issues in the monthly initiation?
