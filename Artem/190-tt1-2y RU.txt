**Comments:**
We're still waiting to receive more details about the upcoming Public Places Safety (PPS) regulations to see how they impact the project. There's a chance that it will add extra work and cost to the project, but regardless, it's best to know as soon as possible and adjust our plans accordingly.
We're still trying to find acoustic panels that can pass Noor's criteria for aesthetics while still matching the technical requirements. It seems to be taking much longer than expected.
