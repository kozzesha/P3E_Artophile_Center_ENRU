s: After a workshop with the team
q: OK, we spent 3 hours and reviewed everything, but no new options were found and none of the existing options were updated.
q: So, no changes.
q: However, I'm more confident about them now.
q: So, here are the options...

n---
**Options:**
850 artopools in 17 months with normal concrete
+85 artopools for self-colored concrete
+170 artopools for finishing within 12 months
---n

q: The values are the original ones created in A05, when we were working on the Deliverables Map. 
q: Later on, we planned responses to risks, and some of them included the impacts of time and cost on the project...

n---
**Changes:**
Transparent cover for the roof of the main hall: +8 artopools, +1 week
Solar panels: +4 artopools
Extra acoustic treatment: +2 to +4 artopools
---n

q: The time impact is low and I can ignore it for now.
q: The cost impact is about 15 artopools, which I'll add to the options.


j-a08: Send the options to Anan.
