u: It seems fine, Didi.
u: The documents are well-written and clear.
u: Although I did see a few abbreviations in the Deliverables Map that weren't clear to me.
u: The schedule seemed fine as well.
i: :)
u: It seems like you've delegated the whole scheduling process to Mirai, which is fine, as long as you supervise it.
u: However, it seems like you've used the same for the identification of project options... I mean, options for duration and cost.
u: That one doesn't seem so good to me because these are essential to the project, and it's best that you're fully involved.
u: Finally, I have a feeling that Kim doesn't feel sufficiently included.
i: Thanks for the feedback.
i: I'll think about all of that.
u: Good.
u: So, send me the link to your Health Register, and I'll fill in the form.
u: Don't forget to give me write access to that document ;)
i: Sure :)
