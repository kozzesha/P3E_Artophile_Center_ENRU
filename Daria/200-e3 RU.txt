Hi everyone,
Thanks to you, we were able to finish these deliverables this month:

* Main hall › Ceiling › Cladding and insulation
* Information room › Lighting
* Conference room #3 › HVAC
* WC #2 › Floor
* WC #2 › Walls
* Conference room #2 › Fire protection
* Administration room
* Security room › Computer network

We've also decided to use non-technical language in our conversations with stakeholders outside the team, to improve effectiveness.
We'll get together soon to initiate another monthly cycle. Looking forward to talking to you then!

Regards,
Didi
