s: The next day
u: So, Didi, everything seems fine to me.
u: Your documents are very well structured, and I like the way you managed the trends in your project's health.
i: Thanks.
u: I assume you've handed over the product already, haven't you?
i: Yes, I have.
i: They appointed Kyung, and we spent 5 days on the hand-over.
i: It's all done without any issues.
u: So, has the whole product been accepted?
i: Yes.
u: Where are the hand-over and acceptance documented?
i: Hmm...
i: We did it orally.
u: You need to ask for written approval.
u: Think of it like this: What if something goes wrong in 5 years, and Kyung is long retired and uncontactable.
u: How would you show that you've done your work properly?
i: You're right.
i: I'll do that.
