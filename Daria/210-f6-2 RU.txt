Hello everyone,
About 2 years ago, we had the idea of opening a convention center to facilitate artistic and cultural initiatives in Artopolis while also improving the reputation and public image of Artophile.
Today, we're done implementing this idea, and I should say, it's been done very well. I'd especially like to thank Didi, the project manager, for facilitating the whole process and making it easy for everyone to work on this project; to Eris and the rest of the board for supporting us; to Imani, Noor, Azar, and everyone else in the design department for their monumental work; to Eka, Kim, Darci, Monet, Zia, Celes, Mirai, and everyone else who
contributed. I'm really proud of you all.

Regards,
Anan
