Hello everyone,
Just a quick note to let you know that the Artophile Center project has recently been approved, and we're going to start execution very soon. You may have a part to play in this project at some stage, and the rest of the project team and I are looking forward to that.
In case you don't know, the Artophile Center is a convention center we will build in place of the existing old warehouse. It will be used for our own events as well as external ones, with an emphasis on artistic and cultural events.
Our plan is to finish this project within 17 months.

Regards,
Didi
