s: Meeting with Jehan
u: Hey Didi!
i: Hi Jehan.
u: OK, I've seen your documents, and I have a few questions about your refined plans.
i: Sure.
u: It's all about the contracts you need to have in the future.
u: First, I see the new items in your schedule, but I don't see any changes to your stakeholder list.
u: You know that all contracts must be signed by the procurement department?
i: Hmm...
i: Not really.
i: None of my previous projects needed external contracts.
i: I thought I'd sign them myself.
u: No.
u: Contracts are sensitive, and a simple mistake can cause a lot of trouble for the company.
u: In fact, we've had a case in the past where a project manager signed a simple contract for scaffolding and it turned out that a clause in that contract forced all our future projects to use that company for scaffolding for 5 years!
i: Wow!
i: That doesn't sound good.
u: No.
u: That's why we have this policy now, that only the procurements department can sign contracts.
u: There are legal experts in that department who make sure it's done properly.
