u: So, Didi, have you also checked to see what other contracts will be needed in the project and how they will impact the overall schedule?
i: These are the only contracts for the upcoming month.
u: I know, but I don't see any signs of contracts in the rest of the schedule.
u: Your goal in B01 is not limited to detailing the plan for the upcoming month, but also revising the whole plan when needed.
u: Those contracts have a potential impact, and you may realize, for example, that in order to finish the project as scheduled, you need to start preparing more contracts as soon as possible.
i: Oh, I see.
i: That's correct...
i: We've not thought too much about the other contracts, and didn't consider them in the schedule.
