Hi Anan,
We're ready to start the first cycle. This cycle starts now, and continues until the end of next month because we're already past the middle of the current month. After that, all cycles will start at the beginning of the calendar month.

We've revised the plans and detailed our work for the cycle, which includes site preparation and demolition of the old warehouse. Both deliverables are expected to be finished by the end of the cycle. We also made some changes to the rest of the plan - namely, the addition of provisions for signing contracts with external contractors - but that didn't have any impact on the duration or the cost.

The Deliverables Map, Product Description, and schedule are attached. Please let us know whether we can start the cycle.

Regards,
Didi
