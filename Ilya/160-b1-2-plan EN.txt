i: At the beginning of each month, we'll detail the plan for the upcoming month and revise the rest if necessary, conduct a few extra activities, and then start executing that month's work.
u: Do the cycles have to match calendar months and start at the beginning of the month, or can they start, for example, on the 20th of each month?
