i: So, what have you done here?
u: We broke down 'site mobilization' and 'demolition of the warehouse' into smaller items.
u: Both of them will be done by external contractors, and so we have items for the contracts as well.
u: We also changed the title of 'site mobilization' to 'site preparation', to contain both the mobilization and other things such as buying insurance and receiving permissions from authorities.
i: Alright.
i: Did you make any changes to the overall schedule?
u: No.
u: There were changes to the schedule for those two main deliverables, but they didn't impact anything else.
