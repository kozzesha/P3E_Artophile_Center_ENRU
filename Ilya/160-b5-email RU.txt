Hi everyone,
Thanks for attending the monthly kick-off meeting. As we briefly discussed in the meeting, the first cycle starts now, and during this cycle we will finish two deliverables: site preparation and the demolition of the old warehouse.
Thanks for all your help so far. Let's look forward to a great start to the project!

Regards,
Didi
