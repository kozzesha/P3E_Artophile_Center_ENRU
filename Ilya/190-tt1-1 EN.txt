**Comments:**
We're still waiting to receive more details about the upcoming Public Places Safety (PPS) regulations to see how they impact the project. There's a chance that it will add extra work and cost to the project, but regardless, it's best to know as soon as possible and adjust our plans accordingly.
We're still trying to find acoustic panels that can pass Noor's criteria for aesthetics while still matching the technical requirements. It seems to be taking much longer than expected.

q: Did I really travel in time, or is it a really elaborate joke from my colleagues?


j-tt1-2n: Call Tiam and ask about it.
j-tt1-2y: Just accept it as a simple time travel and move on.
