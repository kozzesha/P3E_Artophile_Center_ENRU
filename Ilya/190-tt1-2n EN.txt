i: Tiam, this is Didi... there's something wrong!
u: What's the problem, Didi?
i: I just checked online, and it seems to be April 25th, 2022, while it was August 23rd, 2021 only a few minutes ago!
u: Oh, I see that you've meet Berty!
i: Is it a joke?
u: No, it's real.
u: But make sure you don't tell anyone about it.
u: And, by the way, congratulations!
i: On what?
u: On being selected!
u: Berty only selects good project managers.
i: How can I go back?
u: You can't.
u: It's a one-way travel.
u: In fact, it's not real travel, if you ask me, because the whole world, including yourself, takes its normal course, while your consciousness at a certain point in time is moved to another time in the future.
u: It's like you've passed the whole time without remembering it.
u: I call it time-skipping instead of time-travel.
i: But...
u: Sorry, Didi, I have to go.
u: Don't worry about it... and don't talk to anyone else about it.


j-tt1-2y: Let's move on!
