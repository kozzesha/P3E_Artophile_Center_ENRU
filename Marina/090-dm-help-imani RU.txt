u: Hello, this is Imani.
i: Hi Imani, this is Didi.
u: Hmm... Didi...
i: I'm the project manager of the Artophile Center.
u: Aha, yes.
u: How can I help you?
i: Can you help me map the deliverables of the project?
u: I've already assigned Azar to help you with the project; why are you asking me for help instead of Azar?
i: Well, I thought it might be handier.
u: No, it's not.
i: OK, sorry to bother you.
i: I'll call Azar.
q: Well... that wasn't nice.
q: Imani may be right.
q: I've asked to have an architect assigned to the project, and then I contact the director of the design department as if I don't have access to an architect!


j-dm-help-azar: Ask Azar for help.
