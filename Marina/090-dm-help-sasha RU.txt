u: Hello, Sasha speaking.
i: Hi Sasha, this is Didi.
i: Can you help me map the deliverables of the project?
u: Hmm... I don't know much about those things.
u: Why don't you ask Azar for help?
i: OK, I'll ask Azar.
i: Thanks... bye.
q: Sasha is right... mapping deliverables has a lot more to do with the technical aspects of the project and its architecture than its business aspects.


j-dm-help-azar: Ask Azar for help.
