u: Well, Didi, if you want, we can have the doors and windows as a subset of the walls.
i: Sounds good to me.
i: Do we have anything else for the walls?
u: There are the walls themselves, which will be load-bearing concrete walls with built-in insulation and color that will be left exposed on both the outside and the inside, which means that we won't have separate elements for insulation, painting, and the like.
u: We'll only need to have acoustic treatment on the inside.
u: And finally, there are doors and windows in those walls.
i: OK, give me a minute to add them to the map.

u: Didi, it's important that the load-bearing walls have builtâ€‘in insulation and color, and that they will be exposed.
u: Do we need to add them under the 'load-bearing walls'?


j-dmc-13-yes: Yes, add them as new items under the existing one.
j-dmc-13-comment: No, add them as a comment on the existing element.
