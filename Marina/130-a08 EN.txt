Hi Anan,
We're approaching the end of the project initiation, and we're ready for your go/no-go decision.
Based on our initiation, the original time and cost expectations are not too far off, but not an exact match either. We could prepare for these options:

865 artopools in 17 months with normal concrete
+100 artopools for self-colored concrete
+185 artopools for finishing within 12 months

The latest versions of the Project Description, Deliverables Map, Follow-Up Register, and schedule are attached, in case you need them.
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Regards,
Didi
