Hi Didi,
I was checking the benefits of the Artophile Center when I came up with an idea: to arrange a national conference about sustainable architecture. Naturally, it would be held in the Artophile Center.
I was thinking of having Mirai as the project manager. Is it a good idea in your opinion?

Regards,
Anan
