Hi Anan,
The conference is an interesting idea.
Mirai has a bright future in project management, but may be too inexperienced to manage such a large project. Besides risking the success of the project, any shortcoming may discourage Mirai from pursuing this profession further.
I know that Jehan doesn't have any projects on at the moment. I think Jahan could be a good candidate for you. Mirai can help Jehan in this project and learn from it at the same time. After that, I think Mirai would have enough experience to become a project manager for future projects.

Regards,
Didi
