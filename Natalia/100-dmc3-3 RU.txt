Hi Didi,
We have a new group of interns in the company. Each of them is appointed to a department related to their field, but there's one person, Mirai, who's a Master's student in project management, with an emphasis on scheduling, and we don't have a project management department. Would you like to have Mirai on your team?

Regards,
Eris
