i: There are many dependencies in a construction project, and those are the main criteria in deciding the order of items.
i: As a result, we need to use a dependency-based schedule.
u: Don't all projects have dependencies, Didi?
i: It's a matter of degree.
i: In an IT development project, for example, you can form your deliverables in a way that minimizes dependencies.
i: Then you can develop them in any order you like.
i: You will decide about a criterion or a set of criteria, and using them, you will prioritize and order those items.
i: That's the case when you use a priority-based schedule, like those you see on task boards or Kanban boards.
u: OK, I'll prepare a dependency-based schedule.
u: Should it be high-level or detailed?


j-dmc3-9h: High level
