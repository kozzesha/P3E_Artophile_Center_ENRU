i: I've checked with 4 insurance companies.
i: It was a little difficult because they offer too many options.
i: In the end,
i: I picked two options from two different insurance companies.
i: Both of them seem fine to me,
i: and Zia is checking them right now.
i: We'll have one selected and signed by the end of the week.
i: The biggest risk for someone like me in a case like this is to have something seemingly harmless in the agreement that turns out to be a big problem, because these are really complicated documents.
i: However, I'm not that worried, because Zia and the others in the procurement department take care of that.
