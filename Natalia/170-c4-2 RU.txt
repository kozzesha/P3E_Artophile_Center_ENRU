Hi everyone,
Thanks for coming to the weekly kick-off meeting.
As we discussed, we will be working on these items this week:

- Insurance
- Permissions
- Mobilization contract

We didn't identify any new risks this time, but let me know if you came up with anything later, or if you have any issues.

Regards,
Didi
