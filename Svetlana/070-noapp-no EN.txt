Hi Anan,
I'm afraid that's not a great setup for us. When we don't have architects appointed to the project, but only assign tasks to them, they won't have a full sense of the project, which increases our risks, including the basic risk you mentioned in our first meeting.
I'm hoping to have one architect appointed to this project for now. Can you help with that?

Regards,
Didi
