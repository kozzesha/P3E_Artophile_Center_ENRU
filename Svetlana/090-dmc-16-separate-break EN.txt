t---
start-textree
= Artophile Center
== Site mobilization
== Demolition of the warehouse
== The building
=== Main hall
==== Earthwork
==== Foundation
==== Walls â€¦==== Ceiling
==== Floor
=== Information room
=== Storage room
=== Conference room #3
=== WC #2
=== Utility room
=== IT room
=== Conference room #2
=== Administration room
=== Conference room #1
=== WC #1
=== Meeting room #1
=== Meeting room #2
=== Security room
== Surroundings
=== Parking lot
=== Driveways and walkways
