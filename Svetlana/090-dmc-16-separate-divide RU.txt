i: Let me try something...
i: What if we create two new root elements for the building and divide the items between them like this?

t---
start-textree
= Artophile Center
== Site mobilization
== Demolition of the warehouse
== The building
=== General
==== Earthwork
==== Foundation
=== Areas
==== Main hall
===== Walls â€¦
===== Ceiling
===== Floor
==== Information room
==== Storage room
==== Conference room #3
==== WC #2
==== Utility room
==== IT room
==== Conference room #2
==== Administration room
==== Conference room #1
==== WC #1
==== Meeting room #1
==== Meeting room #2
==== Security room
== Surroundings
=== Parking lot
=== Driveways and walkways
=== Gardens

u: Are you happy with that, Didi?
i: I don't know.
i: 'General' and 'Areas' can be considered deliverables, but they're a little artificial.
i: Also, the whole map is getting a little too crowded.
u: I agree.
u: What if instead of having earthwork and foundation for the whole building, we break them down into areas and add them under the existing areas?
