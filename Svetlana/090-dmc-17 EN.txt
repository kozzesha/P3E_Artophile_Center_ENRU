u: OK, I've been thinking...
u: I asked you to add an item for the 'floor', and what I had in mind for it was insulation and finishing, but now we have the 'earthwork' and 'foundation' elements beside it, and I'm starting to think that we may be able to move them under the 'floor' item.
i: Not a bad idea. Here we go...
