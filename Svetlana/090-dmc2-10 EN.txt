u: But these are not limited to the main hall; we have them everywhere.
i: Yes, Monet; I'm just adding them for one area right now.
i: I'll add them everywhere later on.
u: OK.
u: Some of those areas are slightly different, though.
u: For example, we don't have the 'music/PA system' in the storage and utility room.
i: I understand.
i: I'll double-check them with you a little later.
u: There are also things like air conditioning and fire protection that have both mechanical and electrical aspects. Maybe more mechanical... Kim can tell you more about them.
