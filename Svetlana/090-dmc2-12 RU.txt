u: Didi, I see here that you have items for 'floor', 'walls', and 'ceiling', and then separate items for lighting and so on.
u: Most of those other things are on the walls, ceiling, or floor anyway.
u: Usually on more than one of those three.
u: Shouldn't they go under the 'floor', 'walls', and 'ceiling' elements?
i: Good question, Monet!
i: I didn't think about that.
i: When we call an item a 'ceiling', we expect everything that belongs to the ceiling to be there, which is not the case right now.
i: So, tell me, when you think about something like 'lighting', do you envisage separate deliverables for the floor, walls, and ceiling, or just one in general?
u: One in general.
i: Is it the same with the music system, computer network, fire protection, and lighting?
u: Yes.


j-dmc2-13-outside: So, we should keep them outside the 'floor', 'walls', and 'ceiling' elements. 
j-dmc2-13-inside: So, we should merge them into the 'floor', 'walls', and 'ceiling' elements.
