i: So, we should keep them outside the 'floor', 'ceiling', and 'walls' items. But then, we still have the original problem you pointed out.
u: What should we do, Didi?
i: I can think of two ways to do it...
i: One option is to rename the existing 'floor', 'walls', and 'ceiling' items into something that makes it clear that they only contain the structure and finish...
i: And the second option is to add another layer: one for the structure and finish, one for the mechanical, electrical, and piping, and one for the furniture.
u: Adding another layer may make it too crowded.
i: Correct.
u: So, do you want to rename them?
i: That may be a good idea.
i: But what could the name be?
i: Something that's not too long.
u: Something like 'structure and finish of the walls'?
i: Too long.
u: So, call it 'walls SF'.


j-dmc2-14-sf: Add 'SF' to the end of the titles.
j-dmc-14-nosf: No, that's not clear enough.
