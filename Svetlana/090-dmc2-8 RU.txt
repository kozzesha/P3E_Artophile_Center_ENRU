i: It's a hierarchical map of the deliverables in the project.
i: We usually use a mind map to visualize it, because that makes it easier.
i: See, this is what we have at the moment for this project...

i: It means that we have 4 major deliverables for the project, although they don't all have the same size and level of importance.
i: Then, 'the building' and the 'surroundings' are broken down into smaller deliverables, and each of those into smaller ones.
i: This gives us an understanding of what is needed in the project.
u: I understand, Didi.
u: I've seen a similar thing, but it had a different name...
u: I think they used to call it a Work Breakdown Structure.
i: Correct, that's practically the same thing.
i: Although most people use activities, disciplines, and other things in their Work Breakdown Structure instead of deliverables, even though it's necessary for a Work Breakdown Structure to be deliverable-based.
i: That's why we use the name Deliverables Map to avoid that confusion.
u: I see.
u: Good choice.
