u: Hi Didi.
u: How can I help?
i: We need to have a team member from your department.
i: Can I ask you to appoint someone?

u: This project is not approved yet, and so I can't appoint anyone to it.
u: If you have any questions, you can come here and I'll ask one of our staff to help you.


j-dmc2-direct-nos: Thank Eka and go there immediately.
j-dmc2-direct-ss: Explain that the resource appointment should be made now.
