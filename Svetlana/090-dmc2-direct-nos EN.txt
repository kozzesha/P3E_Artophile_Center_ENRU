s: A little later in front of Eka's office
q: Alright, that should be Eka's office...
i: Hi Eka!
u: Didi, how can I help you?
i: We just talked, and you told me I could come here if I needed help with the mechanical aspects of the project.
u: Yes, but I didn't mean right now.
u: Everyone is busy at the moment.
i: When is a good time?
u: We have a deadline in 3 weeks.
u: It will be fine after that.
i: But that's too long.
i: Could we make it sooner?
u: As I told you, we're busy with serious projects, and I can't spend my resources on a project that is not even approved and may never happen.
u: Now, if you don't mind, I have to get back to work.
q: What a nice person!
q: I'll just leave...
q: I don't know what to do about it.
q: I can proceed with the electrical engineering part, but 3 weeks is a long time.
q: I can't hold everything until then.
q: If only I had more power to *encourage* Eka to help me!
