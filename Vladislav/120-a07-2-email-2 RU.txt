Hi Didi,
Sure, I'd be happy to.
Send me the project documents to take a look. Then we can arrange for a short meeting so I can ask any questions I may have, and then I can give my feedback.
In the meantime, I need your permission to contact some of your stakeholders and ask them a few questions.

Regards,
Tiam
