i: Hi, Tiam!
u: Hi, Didi, come in.
u: Take a seat.
i: Thanks.
u: So, I've checked the Project Description, Deliverables Map, and Follow-Up Register, browsed through the schedule, and also talked to a few of your stakeholders.
i: OK...
u: It seems that you have a strong and involved sponsor, don't you?
i: Yes, absolutely, and I'm very happy about that.
u: I hope it's only about the high-level aspects of the project.
i: It is.
i: Anan has never tried to micro-manage me.
u: Was this relationship limited to Anan supporting you, or also making high-level decisions?
