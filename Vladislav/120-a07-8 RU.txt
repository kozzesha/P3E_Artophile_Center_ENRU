u: And how do you do that, Didi?
i: We use the company's Nextcloud to store all our documents.
i: I've created a directory for the project, and all the documents are in there.
i: Nextcloud has its own versioning system that we use for minor updates, and at specific times, I store a separate snapshot for approved documents.
u: How about permissions?
i: For now, team members have write access to all documents except for the Project Description, which only I have write access to.
i: All executives and managers in the company have read access to the documents.
u: Alright, sounds good.
u: I think we're done.
