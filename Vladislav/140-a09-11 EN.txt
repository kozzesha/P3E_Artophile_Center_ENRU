s: The day after the kick-off meeting

e---
Hi Didi,
Well done with the kick-off meeting. I've never been to such a kick-off meeting before - both pleasant and effective. Having a barbeque was a wild idea that I could never have imagined would work so well!
You really improved our image among the board. It will be easier to get their support in the future.

Regards,
Anan
