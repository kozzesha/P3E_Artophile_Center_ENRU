**Cause:**      This project doesn't have an external customer.
**Effect:**     Internal departments may give priority to projects with external customers (to keep the customers satisfied), and as a result, ignore this project.
**Impact:**     The project may be finished a lot later than expected and be of low quality.
**Response:**   Strong sponsorship / continuous monitoring of the situation / getting all executives involved in the project
**Custodian:**  Anan
**Status:**     open
