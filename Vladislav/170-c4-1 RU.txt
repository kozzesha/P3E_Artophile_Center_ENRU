u: So, Didi, time for C04?
i: Yes, Mirai.
u: I don't understand, though...
u: Why do we need to send an email when we've just finished the meeting with the same topics as the email?
i: To be sure that there's no misunderstanding, and also in case someone couldn't attend the meeting.
i: Don't forget that our team is still very small, but that will change very soon.
u: I see.


j-c4-2: Start working on the email.
