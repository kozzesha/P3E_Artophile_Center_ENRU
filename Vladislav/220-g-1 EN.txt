Hello everyone,
A quick update on the biannual evaluation of the Artophile Center: In the first 6 months, we've hosted 5 artistic/cultural events and 3 business events. Also, the name "Artophile Center" has appeared 12 times in the media, which is great for our reputation.
Overall, most critics have identified the Artophile Center as a great contribution to art and culture in Artopolis.

Regards,
Anan
