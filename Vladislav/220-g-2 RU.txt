s: Yet another 6 months later

Hello everyone,
It's been a year since we opened the Artophile Center. I'm glad to announce that it's been a resounding success. It's had more than 500 mentions in the media with lots of praise, and we've hosted about 70 events. It's hard to measure, but we believe that some of our current clients have selected us because of our improved reputation.

Regards,
Anan
