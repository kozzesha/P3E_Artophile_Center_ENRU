Hi Anan,
It sounds like a good idea to have such a conference.
I believe Mirai is a good candidate for managing this project. I used to ask Mirai to arrange all our workshops and meetings in the Artophile Center project, and they were always done perfectly. Your project is, of course, much larger and more complicated, but I don't see why Mirai can't handle it.

Regards,
Didi
